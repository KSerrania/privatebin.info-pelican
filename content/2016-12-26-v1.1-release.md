Summary: This release adds Italian and Russian translations to PrivateBin and fixes an XSS and a database issue.

**This release adds Italian and Russian translations to PrivateBin and fixes an XSS and a database issue.**

Fortunately the CSP headers introduced in version 1.0 suppressed the XSS issue in modern browsers. But [older browsers](http://caniuse.com/contentsecuritypolicy) would still be affected when clicking on the "Raw text" button of a markdown formatted paste containing JavaScript. The issue was introduced with the change in version 1.0 that displays markdown code instead of the rendered HTML in the "raw" mode.

The other fixed issue concerns the automatic purging of outdated pastes, which was introduced in version 1.0. When using the database model instead of the default file based store, pastes set to "never" expire were always purged, too.

## Benefits of switching to the new release

If you are using the database model instead of the filesystem one and offer pastes that "never" expire, then you should upgrade or disable the purge by [setting the `batchsize` to 0 in your configuration](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Configuration#purge).

Apart from fixing the XSS issue, markdown pastes containing HTML code will now be properly displayed in the "raw" mode.

Both of these issues affected only version 1.0. There are of course [many more benefits in switching to this release](https://privatebin.info/news/v1.0-release.html), if you are still using a version of PrivateBin or ZeroBin before 1.0.

## Update procedure

When updating please make sure to adjust the [`cspheader`](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Configuration#cspheader) setting. We recommend you to either comment the setting out in order to use our default [recommend CSP header](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/1.1/cfg/conf.ini.sample#L63) or adjust the header so it matches the new default one (mainly just add the `referrer no-referrer;` part).
